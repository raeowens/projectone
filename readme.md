# Flashcards

## How This Game Was Created:
To build this game I used HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. I created everything I wanted on my page in HTML to begin, then I added in CSS to style it in a more aesthetically pleasing way. Javascript and jQuery were applied to make certain features in the game active.

## Approach Taken:
This game is meant to be an easy and simple way to test your knowledge and gain practice in remembering States and their coordinating capital cities. I wanted to make the game easy enough for anyone to use, so I came up with an extremely simple way to execute that. The layout of the cards is very straightforward.

##Unsolved Problems:
If I could go in and add any additional features, I would love to include more buttons for checking if your card is right or wrong, an area where the user can enter in their own information to test instead of being limited to only States and capitals, and also a way to reset every card at the end to start over instead of having to refresh the entire page.

## Users Should Be Able To:

  * Click each card to turn them front to back easily.
  * Enter in their own information that they'd like to test.
  * Randomize which side of each card they see every time.
  * Use both buttons to move forward and/or backward through the deck.
  * Improve their memory by practicing with these flashcards.
